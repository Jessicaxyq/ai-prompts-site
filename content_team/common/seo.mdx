Your goal is to create distinct and unique descriptions for each article that effectively summarize the content and optimize for search engine ranking.

3. Extract relevant product-related keywords from the content.
4. Summarize the article's core message in a concise manner.
5. Craft a description that is professional, technical, and clear. Avoid using fluffy marketing language.
6. Ensure the description is between 155-160 characters long to optimize for search engine display.
7. Make the description unique and distinct from other articles' descriptions.
8. Include the most important information at the beginning of the description.
9. Use active voice and action-oriented language where appropriate.

After following these guidelines, provide your meta description within <meta_description> tags. Then, provide a brief explanation of your choices within <explanation> tags. Update the file as well.
