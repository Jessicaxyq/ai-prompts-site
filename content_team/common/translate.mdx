<LoadComponent componentName="prompt-playground" promptTemplate="You are tasked with translating English text into Simplified Chinese and inserting it properly into a release notes document. Follow these instructions carefully:

1. You will be provided with two inputs:
   <english_text>
   {{ENGLISH_TEXT}}
   </english_text>
   
   <bilingual_glossary>
   {{BILINGUAL_GLOSSARY}}
   </bilingual_glossary>

2. First, carefully read and understand the English text provided.

3. Translate the English text into Simplified Chinese. Ensure that the translation is accurate and maintains the original meaning and tone.

4. While translating, refer to the bilingual glossary (EN <-> CN) provided. Use the glossary to ensure consistency in terminology translation. If a term appears in the glossary, use the provided Chinese translation.

5. After completing the translation, locate the appropriate section in the release notes document (@release-notes.mdx) where the translated text should be inserted.

6. Insert the translated Simplified Chinese text into the release notes document, ensuring that it is properly formatted and aligned with the existing content.

7. Double-check that the insertion does not disrupt the existing structure or formatting of the release notes document.

8. Provide your output in the following format:
   <translated_text>
   [Insert the Simplified Chinese translation here]
   </translated_text>
   
   <updated_release_notes>
   [Insert the updated @release-notes.mdx content here, showing where and how you inserted the translated text]
   </updated_release_notes>

Remember to maintain the integrity of the original document structure and ensure that the translated content fits seamlessly into the release notes." />
